## Setup

Aurelia is an amazing framework that embraces simple and clean code without sacrificing power. In this tutorial we'll introduce you to the simplicity of Aurelia through the construction of a "Todo" application. You'll see just how clean and simple your application code can be and you'll learn several of the basic concepts and capabilities of Aurelia.

Before we start writing some code, you'll need to get setup with a basic project structure. There are several ways to setup Aurelia, including using our command line tools, Webpack, Yeoman or our skeletons. However, to start you out, we're going to show you a basic script-tag setup that requires no additional tools or build systems. Please begin by downloading the basic script setup by clicking the button below.

With this setup, you can choose between two popular programming language options: ESNext and TypeScript. If you would like to stay strictly with spec-compliant next-generation ECMAScript, you will want to go with the ESNext option. However, if you like strong typing and rich compile-time verification and tooling for your language, you'll want to go with TypeScript.

Once you've made your language choice, you'll need to do two things:

*   Configure this documentation to show all code samples in your preferred programming language.
*   Configure your Aurelia project to use your preferred programming language.

Let's configure this documentation first. If you scroll down a bit and look to the right of any source-code example, you will see a dropdown for selecting your preferred programming language. Click that and be sure to select the language that matches your choice.

Now let's setup your project. First, unzip the downloaded files on your hard drive. Doing so will provide you with the default folder structure and scripts needed to complete this tutorial and continue your learning and experimentation afterward. You'll also want to open the folder in your favorite text editor so you can navigate between files, make edits and add new files. The first file we need to look at is the `index.html`. This is what kicks off our app and it's also where we configure your programming language selection. You should see something like this in your `index.html`:
